        This website documents the learning goals for node.js course at KEA. The goal
        for this website is to be a go to documentation for using express with node.js
        throughout this course. Also, some basic JavaScript will be covered such
        as functions and promises, aswell as going
        through http, client/server, working with js modules 
    </p>
    
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold m-4">JavaScript</h1>
    <p class="my-3 m-3 leading-7">
        JavaScript was invented as an adition to HTML and CSS. This would make it possible
        to write functions to make any HTML update dynamically according to the choice of the users
        who are using a website. <br>
        JavaScript is currently one of the most written programming languages in the world, and even though
        adding dynamic changes to any user interface, the JavaScript language has a lot more to offer
        nowadays, than it had back when it was invented. <br>
        JavaScript can be written in any browser. Just take a look yourself! <br> <br>
        1) Open up Google Chrome <br>
        2) Go to the developers tool by right clicking and press inspect <br>
        3) Go to the console <br>
        
        In the console, it's possible to write functions, declaring variables and much more. <br>
        But now, lets define a function and use it. <br>
        Write this into the console: <br>
    </p>

        <div class="w-100 m-3 bg-black text-white rounded-xl">
            <code class="text-white">function multiply(a,b) {<br>return a*b;<br>}</code>
        </div>

        <p class="my-3 m-3 leading-7">
        If we call this functions and enter the two parameters, we can see that this function
        returns the answer for multiplying these values</p>

    </p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold m-4">Node</h1>
    <p class="m-3 my-3 leading-7">
         Rather than using JavaScript in our browser, it is possible to install Node as a runtime enviroment
         for JavaScript. This means that it can run anywhere as long as Node is installed. <br>
         <a class="underline"href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">Node.js download</a> <br>
         Once it's downloaded, open op the terminal and make sure Node is downloaded: <br>
    </p>
    <div class="w-100 m-3 bg-black text-white rounded-xl">
        <code>node -v</code>
    </div>

    <p class="m-3 leading-7 my-4">
        If a version shows up, Node is downloaded. <br>
        This means we can access Node in our terminal and write JavaScript code and run it.
        To do this, write the exact same code as in the browser and call the function:
    </p>
    <div class="w-100 m-3 bg-black text-white rounded-xl">
        <code>function multiply(a,b) {return a*b;} <br>
        undefined <br>
        multiply(3,2) <br>
        6
        </code>
    </div>

    <p class="m-3 leading-7 my-4">
        To exit the terminal press CRTL + C twice
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold m-4">Git</h1>
    <p class="my-3 m-3 leading-7">
        Git is a version control systems that allows you to stage current versions of your code. 
        It also has tracking, so it's possible to go back to previous versions.
        GitHub is the primary service to publish code. Once the code is ready and a repository is set up
        on GitHub, it's very easy to publish the code. <br> Open a terminal in VS Code and commit and push with these commands:<br>
    </p>

    <div class="w-100 m-3 bg-black text-white rounded-xl">
        <code class="text-green-600">// add all new and edited files</code> <br> 
        <code>git add -A</code><br>
        <code class="text-green-600">// commit the changes with a message</code><br>
        <code>git commit -m "MESSAGE"</code><br>
        <code class="text-green-600">// push the code to the repository</code><br>
        <code>git push</code>
